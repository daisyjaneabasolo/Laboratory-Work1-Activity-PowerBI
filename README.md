## PART 3: | Step 3: Sales by Category
![Sales by Category](https://github.com/daisyjaneabasolo/Laboratory-Work1-Activity-PowerBI/blob/bfde732183fe7176fa9ab887e5db210bc4b0ad9b/Sales%20by%20Category.png)

**Answers to Questions:**  
- **Which category dominates?**  
  Electronics.

  The sales are not balanced. Office Supplies make up only 19.99% of sales, about half of the other two categories. Electronics (40.82%) and Furniture (39.19%) are almost equal, but the low sales of Office Supplies make the distribution uneven.

  There is no growth. Sales went down a lot between the two years.
